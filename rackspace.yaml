  LAMP is a software stack containing the following open-source components:
  Linux, Apache, MySQL and PHP
instructions: |
  #### Getting Started
  If you're new to PHP, the [Getting
  Started](http://www.php.net/manual/en/getting-started.php) page can walk you
  through the basics of PHP and it's uses.

  If you chose to enable PHPMyAdmin, you can access it using the username and
  password found in the Credentials section, with the URL listed under
  PHPMyAdmin URL.

  #### Scaling out
  This deployment is configured to be able to scale out easily.  However,
  if you are expecting higher levels of traffic, please look into one of our
  larger-scale stacks.

  #### Details of Your Setup
  This deployment was stood up using [Ansible](http://www.ansible.com/).
  Once the stack has been deployed, Ansible will not run again unless you update the
  stack. **Any changes made to the configuration may be overwritten when the stack
  is updated.**

  [Apache](http://www.apache.org/) was configured to serve contents out
  of /var/www/vhosts/example.com/, where example.com is the domain that
  you provided during the setup.
  
  [PHP](http://www.php.net/) was installed using the packaged version for
  the chosen operating system, in order to ensure that you have the latest
  stable release.

  [Lsyncd](https://github.com/axkibe/lsyncd) has been installed in order to
  sync static content from the Master server to all secondary servers.
  When uploading content, it only needs to be uploaded to the Master node,
  and will be automatically synchronized to all secondary nodes.  By default,
  /var/www will be synchronized, unless otherwise specified during setup.

  MySQL is being hosted on a Cloud Database instance, running MySQL 5.6.
  Backups for MySQL are provided by [Holland](http://wiki.hollandbackup.org/),
  which is running on the Master server.

  Backups are configured using Cloud Backups.  The Master server is configured
  to back up /var/spool/holland and /var/www once per week, and to retain
  these backups for 30 days.

  In order to restore the Database from backup, you will need to first restore
  /var/spool/holland from the appropriate Cloud Backup.  After you have done so,
  you will need to log into the Master server and restore the Holland backup
  to the Cloud Database via the MySQL client.  For more assistance, please
  contact your Support team.

  Monitoring is configured to verify that Apache is running on both the Master
  and all secondary servers, as well as that the Cloud Load Balancer is
  functioning.  Additionally, the default CPU, RAM, and Filesystem checks
  are in place on all servers.

  #### Logging in via SSH
  The private key provided with this deployment can be used to log in as
  root via SSH. We have an article on how to use these keys with [Mac OS X and
  Linux](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-linuxmac)
  as well as [Windows using
  PuTTY](http://www.rackspace.com/knowledge_center/article/logging-in-with-a-ssh-private-key-on-windows).
  This key can be used to log into all servers on this deployment.
  Additionally, passwordless authentication is configured from the Master
  server to all secondary servers.

  #### Additional Notes
  You can add additional servers to this deployment by updating the
  "server_count" parameter for this stack. This deployment is
  intended for low to medium traffic production websites and can be
  scaled as needed to accommodate future growth.

  When scaling this deployment by adjusting the "server_count" parameter,
  make sure that you DO NOT change the "database_flavor" and "database_disk"
  parameters, as this will result in the loss of all data within the
  database.
  
  This stack will not ensure that LAMP or the servers themselves are
  up-to-date.  You are responsible for ensuring that all software is
  updated.

 This stack is intended for low to medium traffic production
 websites and can be scaled as needed to accommodate future
 growth.  This stack includes a Cloud Load Balancer, Cloud
 Database, and a Master server (plus optional secondary
 servers).  It also includes Cloud Monitoring and Cloud
 Backups.

 This stack is running the latest version of
 [Apache](https://www.apache.org//),
 and [PHP](http://www.php.net/).
 with a Cloud Database running
 [MySQL 5.6](http://www.mysql.com/about/).
